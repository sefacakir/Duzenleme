# Snake Game
My simple snake game that I developed using python language and turtle library. But my snake game is a little different. 

## Game Content
As in the classic snake games, each time it eats, the snake grows one unit in length. But there are some special dishes. 

- **Red food:** Increases the snake's length by one unit.
- **Orange Food:** Increases the snake's height by 10 units. One orange bait can be eaten after every five red baits.
- **Blue Food:** After every orange meal comes a blue meal. When the blue food is eaten, there is a random change in the size of the snake.

There is a slowing skill that the player can use in the game. Activated with the x key and slows the speed of the snake for 30 units. To use the skill again, the snake must move 200 units. 

A new feature in the game is that the snake can jump over its tail.
